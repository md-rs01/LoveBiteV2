# LoveBiteV2  is an updated Version of LoveBite üöÄ

This Java-based DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attack simulation tool is designed for educational purposes. It allows users to simulate DDoS attacks by sending multiple HTTP requests to a target `URL`. The tool includes features such as proxy support, firewall bypass methods, and logging capabilities.

## Features ‚ú®

- **HTTP and HTTPS attack methods**
- **Firewall Detected techniques**
- **Firewall bypass techniques**
- **Multi-threaded attack using ExecutorService**
- **Logging of attack details**
- **Color-coded console output for status**

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
- Smooth Internet connection

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/md-rs01/LoveBiteV2.git
    cd LoveBiteV2
    ```

2. **Compile the Java code:**

    ```sh
    javac Dos.java
    ```

3. **Run the program:**

    ```sh
    java Dos
    ```
        Help :
    ```sh
    java Dos -h
    ```
        Uage :
    ```sh
    java Dos -u
    ```

   
## Usage üßë‚Äçüíª

When you run the program, you will be prompted to enter:

1. **Target URL**: The URL of the website to attack.
2. **Number of Threads**: Concurrent threads for the attack.
3. **Attack Method**: `GET` or `POST`.

### Example

  ```sh
  Enter Web URL: http://example.com
  Thread => 100
  ```

The tool will utilize these proxies during the attack. Provide the proxy file path when prompted by the program.

### Logging üìù
The tool logs attack details to *attack_log.txt*  with the following format:-

``` Timestamp: 2024-08-02 12:34:56
    URL: http://example.com
    Total Requests: 100
    Successful Requests: 90
    Failed Requests: 10
    =========================================
```
### Firewall Bypass Methods üîì

The tool includes basic firewall bypass techniques:- 

**Randomizing User-Agents:**
To avoid detection by varying `user-agent` strings.Varying Request Methods: Switching between `GET` and `POST` requests.Using Proxies: To mask the origin of requests.
